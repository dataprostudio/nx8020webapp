Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Product Overview

Product Name: Process Mining Web App
Objective:
    •    Analyze workflows to identify bottlenecks and waste.
    •    Provide optimized workflow suggestions using an LLM model.
    •    Enable interactive visualization of workflows.
    •    Implement a test bed for curated optimized processes.

Target Users:
    •    Businesses using CRM/ERP systems seeking to optimize operations.
    •    Operations managers and analysts.
    •    IT teams working on process efficiency.

Key Features

1. Data Input
    •    File Upload:
    •    Users can upload flat files (e.g., CSV, Excel) containing process logs.
    •    Validate and display uploaded data.
    •    Real-Time Integration:
    •    Pull data from CRM/ERP systems via APIs (e.g., Salesforce, SAP).
    •    Configure API connection with user-provided credentials.

2. Workflow Visualization
    •    Generate interactive workflow diagrams:
    •    Use nodes for tasks and edges for transitions.
    •    Color-coded nodes and edges to highlight bottlenecks and waste.
    •    Zoom, pan, and node exploration features.

3. Process Analysis
    •    Leverage a quantized version of Llama 3.2 for:
    •    Workflow parsing and analysis.
    •    Identification of bottlenecks and redundant tasks.
    •    Recommendations for optimized processes.

4. Test Bed Implementation
    •    Provide a sandbox to simulate and validate suggested workflows.
    •    Track metrics (e.g., time saved, cost efficiency) before actual implementation.

5. Database Management
    •    PostgreSQL:
    •    Store uploaded files and analysis results.
    •    Maintain historical data for comparative analysis.

Technical Requirements

Frontend
    •    Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
    •    Features:
    •    Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices.
    •    Intuitive UI for file uploads and API integration setup.

Backend
    •    Technologies: Node.js with Flask or NGROK for API tunneling.
    •    Responsibilities:
    •    Handle file uploads and API requests.
    •    Integrate with the LLM model and process results.

Database
    •    PostgreSQL setup with:
    •    Tables for user data, uploaded files, analysis results, and workflow simulations.

LLM Integration
    •    Utilize the quantized version of Llama 3.2 to:
    •    Parse log files and API data.
    •    Identify inefficiencies and recommend optimizations.
    •    Connect to the model via a Python Flask API.

User Stories

As a user, I want to:
    1.    Upload my process logs and view a visual representation of workflows.
    2.    Integrate my CRM/ERP system to analyze real-time data.
    3.    Identify bottlenecks and redundant tasks in my workflow.
    4.    Receive actionable recommendations to optimize processes.
    5.    Simulate optimized workflows in a test environment.

Milestones

Phase 1: MVP Development
    1.    Set up file upload and validation.
    2.    Create basic workflow visualization.
    3.    Implement Llama 3.2 integration for static file analysis.
    4.    Deploy Flask backend with NGROK for local testing.

Phase 2: Real-Time Integration
    1.    Develop API connectors for CRM/ERP systems.
    2.    Expand visualization for real-time workflows.

Phase 3: Test Bed and Metrics
    1.    Build sandbox for workflow simulation.
    2.    Integrate metrics tracking and reporting.

Phase 4: Deployment
    1.    Deploy to production with Docker.
    2.    Perform extensive user testing.

Success Metrics
